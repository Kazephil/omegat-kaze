# manifest

There must be a manifest file that indicates that it is an OmegaT plugin. There are two flavors, see below.
Omegat 5.3.0 also supports to provide additional information (valid for both flavors) that can be displayed in the UI.
You can **optionally** provide name, version, author and description.

OmegaT 5.5.0 can show the plugin name and author in Preferences. You are recommended to set these parameters.
You can **optionally** provide an URL of your plugin home page, license and category.
For each there are different manifest entry alternatives, and OmegaT will pick the first one present in the order from
left to right as described in the table below:

| Attribute   | Manifest entry (pick one)                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Name        | Plugin-Name, Bundle-Name, Implementation-Title         |
| Version     | Plugin-Version, Bundle-Version, Implementation-Version |
| Author      | Plugin-Author, Implementation-Vendor, Built-By         |
| Description | Plugin-Description                                     |
| Link        | Plugin-Link                                            |
| License     | Plugin-License                                         |
| Category    | Plugin-Category                                        |

### plugins for OmegaT 2.1.3 and up
A plugin should be declared in `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`:

    OmegaT-Plugin: true
    [Plugin-Name: …]
    [Plugin-Version: x.y.z]
    [Plugin-Author: …]
    [Plugin-Description: …]
    
    Name: my.Class
    OmegaT-Plugin: filter
    
    [Name: my.optional.other.Class
    OmegaT-Plugin: filter]

### plugins for OmegaT 3.0.1 and up
A plugin should be declared in `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`:

    [Plugin-Name: …]
    [Plugin-Version: x.y.z]
    [Plugin-Author: …]
    [Plugin-Description: …]
    [Plugin-Link: https://..]
    [Plugin-Category: filter]
    OmegaT-Plugins: <classname>

where classname is the fully qualified classname of the plugin's initialization class. Multiple classnames can be defined,
like in “Class-Path” attribute, i.e., space separated.
This class should contain the following methods:

    public static void loadPlugins() {}
    public static void unloadPlugins() {}

The `loadPlugins()` method is executed on application startup before any GUI initialization. You can register your
plugin using Core APIs. Please be consult with [Loading Plugins](17.LoadingPlugins.md) and
[Core Events](22.CoreEvents.md).

## Plugin categories

Plugin manifest has a mandatory entry `Plugin-Category`:

    [Plugin-Category: filter]

You can choose a value from following list. A value is not affected the plugin behavior
but it is used when showing a plugin list on preference dialog.

1. filter
2. tokenizer
3. marker
4. machinetranslator
5. base
6. glossary
7. dictionary
8. theme
9. miscellaneous

When plugin has a value other than above, OmegaT will show it as 'unknown' category.
The list of values above is a superset of possible values for 'Omegat-Plugin:' field in
OmegaT 2.1.3 above definition.
