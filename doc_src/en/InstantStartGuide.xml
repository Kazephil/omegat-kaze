	  <para>On macOS most key shortcuts use the <keycap>Command</keycap> 
    key. On Windows and Linux, the equivalent function uses the <keycap>Control</keycap> key.</para>
	<para>To avoid confusion, key shortcuts are described the following way in
	the manual: </para>
  <example><title>Project > Properties...</title>
		<para>On Windows and Linux:

		<para>On macOS:

  <section id="introduction.create.and.open.new.project">
    <title id="introduction.create.and.open.new.project.title">Set up a new project</title>

    <para>To start using OmegaT, first create a project that will hold all your
    files, such as your source files, translation memories, glossaries, and
    eventually your translated files.</para>

	<para>In the <guimenu>Project</guimenu> menu,
    select <menuchoice><guimenuitem>New...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and type a
    name for your project. Remember where you are creating the project, because
    you will need to return to it later.</para>

    <para>After you give your project a name, the <guilabel>Create New
    Project</guilabel> dialog will open. At the top of that dialog, select your
    source file's language and the language that your translated file will be,
    and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to continue.</para>

    <para>If you are interested in other settings of this dialog, you can return
    to it any time by pressing
    <keycombo><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>e</keycap></keycombo>.</para>

    <para>Next, the <guilabel>Project Files</guilabel> dialog opens. Click on
    <guibutton>Copy Files to Source Folder...</guibutton> to select your source
    files. OmegaT will then copy the selected files to the <filename
    class="directory">source</filename> subfolder of your newly created
    project. After the source files have loaded in the
    <guilabel>Editor</guilabel> pane, you can close the <guilabel>Project
    Files</guilabel> dialog.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="introduction.translate.the.segments.one.by.one">
    <title id="introduction.translate.the.segments.one.by.one.title">Translate the file</title>

    <para>OmegaT will present one segment at a time for you to translate.  After
    you have translated each segment, press
    <keycombo><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>u</keycap></keycombo> to move to the
    next untranslated segment (or
    <keycombo><keycap>S</keycap><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>u</keycap></keycombo>
    to move to the next translated segment). Whenever you want to see what your
    translation will look like in its final format, press
    <keycombo><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>d</keycap></keycombo> to generate the
    translated documents, which will be created in the <filename
    class="directory">target</filename> subfolder of your project folder. During
    translation, use the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> and <guimenu>Go To</guimenu>
    menus to perform various useful functions.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="introduction.validate.your.tags">
    <title id="introduction.validate.your.tags.title">Validate your tags</title>

    <para>If your source files are formatted files, e.g. Microsoft Word,
    LibreOffice Writer or HTML, OmegaT will convert the formatting into tags
    that surround the text that you translate. Often documents will also have
    tags that have nothing to do with formatting, but which are also important
    in the source files (and in the translated files). A source sentence might
    look like:</para>
    
	<example>
	  <title>Source segment with decorations</title>
	  <para>OmegaT is an <emphasis role="bold">easy to use</emphasis> program
	  for <emphasis>eager</emphasis> translators</para>
	</example>

    <para>OmegaT, however, will present this sentence in the following
    fashion:</para>

	<example>
	  <title>How decorations are displayed in OmegaT</title>
	  <para>OmegaT is an &lt;t0/&gt;easy to use&lt;t1/&gt; program for
	  &lt;t2/&gt;eager&lt;t3/&gt; translators</para>
    </example>
	
    <para>The tags in OmegaT are greyed, so they are easy to recognise. They are
    protected, so that you cannot modify their contents, but you can delete
    them, enter them by hand or move them around in the target
    sentence. However, if you made mistakes when you typed the formatting tags,
    your translated files might fail to open.  Therefore, press
    <keycombo><keycap>S</keycap><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>v</keycap></keycombo>
    before you generate your translated files, to validate that your tags are
    correct.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="introduction.generate.the.translated.file">
    <title id="introduction.generate.the.translated.file.title">Generate the translated file</title>

    <para>Once you have made certain that there are no tag errors in your
    translation, press <keycombo><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>d</keycap></keycombo>
    to generate the target files, which will be created in the <filename
    class="directory">target</filename> subfolder of your project folder.</para>

        <para>At the end of your translation, OmegaT exports three translation
        memories called <filename>level1</filename>, <filename>level2</filename>
        and <filename>omegat</filename> to your project folder. The
        <filename>level1</filename> and <filename>level2</filename> memories can
        be shared with users of other translation programs. The memory named
        <filename>omegat</filename> can be used by OmegaT itself, in future
        projects that you create. If you place such translation memory files in
        the <filename class="directory">tm</filename> subfolder of a project,
        OmegaT will automatically search them for similar segments, called
        "fuzzy matches".</para>
