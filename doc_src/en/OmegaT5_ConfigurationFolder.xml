  <para>The configuration folder is where most of the OmegaT parameters are stored.</para>

  <section id="">
    <title>source</title>

    <para>The source subfolder contains files to be translated. You can add
    the files to it later. Note that the structure of the source subfolder may
    take any form you like. If the files to be translated are parts of a tree
    structure (as in a website), you need only specify the top-level subfolder
    and OmegaT will maintain the entire contents, while keeping the tree
    structure intact.</para>
